# fla_remake

You can breakaway what exportname you want!

It is used to solve the problem that low-configuration computers cannot open large FLA files

EASY TO USEï¼š

1.Place the. FLA file you want to decompose in the directory

2.Do as it says and wait

3.Zip Compress the generated folder named exportname and change the generated. zip file to. fla
("Because the original compression will contain the parent folder, I am too lazy to resolve it, so please compress it yourself.")

Done!
